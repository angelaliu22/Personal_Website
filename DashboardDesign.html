				<h3>Project Description</h3>
				<p>
					In the class Interaction Design Studio, we had a group assignment that was to create a dashboard for a watchdog organization of a particular region of the world that could be displayed on an Apple Thunderbolt monitor. My team was given North Africa and we chose to focus on the Nile Delta region. The specifications of the dashboard were that it must include a critical factor, an impact display, data on a human factor, data on plant life, data on animal life, and data on weather. The data must be historical as well as include future predictions. We focused on the dragonfly and underwater species and rainfall. Our critical factor was the decline of dragonfly species due to a shortage of fresh water in the region. 
                    <br>
                    Because there was so much data to fit on such a relatively small screen size, we were faced with a challenge. The dashboard also couldn't be interactive so all of the data must be presented above the fold. Below is an outline of our process, as well as all of our concepts.
