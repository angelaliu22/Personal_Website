				<h3>Summary of Work</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>	
					Disclaimer: Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement that I have with Cisco, I can only share a limited amount of information on my work.
				</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>
					I worked at Cisco on the ASR900 team as a Software Engineer Co-op from January 2014 until August 2014. During my time, I had four main responsibilities. The first was to execute regression tests of TCP/IP protocols on various ASR9000 family routers for the current release. The second was to perform upgrade/downgrade tests across software releases to make sure no protocols broke with changes between releases. The third was to modify test scripts to cover cases based on customer reported bugs. The last was to begin the initiative on my team to integrate our test beds into the Cisco Virtual Machine platform IOS XRv. 
				</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>
					My main priority during my co-op was to execute regressions tests in a timely manner to resolve as many scripting issues before the release would be shipped. I was in charge of running all of these protocols on a 10G testbed. This meant that at the beginning of my internship, I set up my own testbed in our lab with several different types of routers and linecards all with 10G connection speeds. With this testbed, on each new release I would load that "image" (current release software) on my test bed and run the testing scripts of our 30 main protocols. Then comes the bulk of my work. I would debug all the failed test cases in each script until all of the protocols were 100% passing. And, this all had to be done before the release ship date. 
				</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					The purpose of performing upgrade/downgrade tests was to insure that a given image was able to downgrade to a previous image and/or upgrade from that image while still running and without any traffic drops or other errors. I was given 5 images to test against 10 previous releases each. Upon an error, I would debug the specific protocol's script. For each of the five images, I logged all of the relevant output into files to send to my manager. 
				</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>
					Cisco's has an internal bug tracking system where each customer reported bug is assigned to the manager who's team is responsible for that area, and the manager in turn assigns each bug to an engineer. I was given a few bugs during my time and each time, I would reproduced the customer's testing environmnet on my own test bed by changing any routers, linecards, or ethernet connections, downgrading or upgrading to the release that the customer found the bug on, and reruning the test cases reported. After successfully reproducing the bug, if I was able to fix it as a test engineer, I would debug the script as well as the system to find the underlying issue. If it was a bug only the developers could fix, I would pass on all my relevant logged information and meet with the developer to pass on the bug. 
				</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>
					Lastly, I was assigned to pilot our team's initiative of transfering our test beds and testing envionrment into the cloud through virtual machines. I set up a UCS server and connected it to my test bed, recreating the routers there. This was one of the last things that I started during my time at Cisco and while I successfully set up the environment in the cloud, I didn't have time to run any scripts before having to transfer all the information to a colleague.
